## Folder and File Structure

- **Modularization**: The code is organized into modules, such as `account`, which encapsulates all logic related to accounts.
- **Files by Responsibility**: Each file within the module has a specific responsibility:

- `service.go`: Business logic and service operations.
- `account.go`: Data structures and functions related to the `account` entity.
- `repository.go`: Implementation of the repository interface for database interaction.
- `interfaces.go`: Definition of interfaces for the repository and the service.

- **Submodules**: If an entity has many services or repository methods, they can be organized into their own submodule, but still within the main module.

## Error Handling

- **Specific Errors**: We use specific errors for different failures, such as `NewValidationFieldError`, `NewBadRequestError`, and `NewNotFoundError`.
- **Error Logging**: Before returning an error, we log the error using a structured logger.
- **Descriptive Error Messages**: Error messages are descriptive and include the context of the error.

## Design Patterns

- **Use of Interfaces**: Interfaces like `RepositoryInterface` and `ServiceInterface` allow for easy replacement of implementations.
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies such as the logger and repository are injected into the services.
- **Data Validation**: We perform validations before creating or manipulating data to ensure they are in the expected format.
- **Use of Context**: Functions receive a `context.Context` for cancellation control and deadlines.
